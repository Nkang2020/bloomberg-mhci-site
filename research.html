Another important aspect we considered was how much time away from work the users could take given our trip coincided with Valentine’s day and the beginning of a weekend. We realized that people might want to leave early for the day and therefore decided to carry chocolates and greeting cards to thank the participants for their generosity with time.</span>

The new framework helped us draft a sequence model workflow exercise for finding patterns during future research methods. We also uncovered gaps and missing information in the flow that needed further inquiry through semi-structured research in the form of a survey.</span>
